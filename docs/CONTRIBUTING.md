## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

#### Style Guide

Follow PEP 8 with these specifics:
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from apps.equipment.models import Equipment

def calculate_health_score(
    equipment: Equipment,
    maintenance_records: List[MaintenanceRecord],
    threshold: int = 80
) -> int:
    """
    Calculate equipment health score based on maintenance history.
    
    Args:
        equipment: Equipment instance to evaluate
        maintenance_records: List of maintenance records
        threshold: Minimum acceptable health score (default: 80)
        
    Returns:
        Health score between 0-100
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If equipment is None or maintenance_records is empty
    """
    if equipment is None:
        raise ValueError("Equipment cannot be None")
    
    # Implementation
    return health_score
```

#### Code Organization

```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from datetime import datetime

# Third-party imports
from django.db import models
from rest_framework import serializers

# Local imports
from apps.core.models import BaseModel
from apps.equipment.utils import generate_equipment_number
```

#### Django Best Practices

```python
# Use select_related for foreign keys
equipment = Equipment.objects.select_related('facility', 'building').get(id=equipment_id)

# Use prefetch_related for reverse relations
facilities = Facility.objects.prefetch_related('equipment_set').all()

# Use Q objects for complex queries
from django.db.models import Q
equipment = Equipment.objects.filter(
    Q(status='operational') | Q(status='maintenance')
)

# Use F expressions for database-level operations
from django.db.models import F
Equipment.objects.filter(id=equipment_id).update(
    operational_hours=F('operational_hours') + 1
)
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

#### Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer const over let, never use var

```typescript
// Define interfaces
interface Equipment {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'operational' | 'maintenance' | 'shutdown';
  healthScore: number;
  facility: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
}

// Component with proper typing
interface EquipmentCardProps {
  equipment: Equipment;
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
  className?: string;
}

export const EquipmentCard: React.FC<EquipmentCardProps> = ({
  equipment,
  onSelect,
  className = ''
}) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    onSelect(equipment.id);
  };

  return (
    <div className={`rounded-lg border p-4 ${className}`} onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{equipment.name}</h3>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Status: {equipment.status}</p>
      <div className="mt-2">
        <span className="text-xs">Health: {equipment.healthScore}%</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### React Best Practices

```typescript
// Use custom hooks for data fetching
export function useEquipment(id: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['equipment', id],
    queryFn: () => fetchEquipment(id),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  });
}

// Use memo for expensive computations
const sortedEquipment = useMemo(() => {
  return equipment.sort((a, b) => b.healthScore - a.healthScore);
}, [equipment]);

// Use callback for event handlers
const handleSubmit = useCallback((data: FormData) => {
  createEquipment(data);
}, [createEquipment]);

// Proper error handling
const { data, error, isLoading } = useEquipment(id);

if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;
if (!data) return <NotFound />;

return <EquipmentDetails equipment={data} />;
```

    name: 'Test Equipment',
    status: 'operational' as const,
    healthScore: 85,
    facility: { id: '456', name: 'Test Facility' }
  };

  it('renders equipment name', () => {
    render(<EquipmentCard equipment={mockEquipment} onSelect={jest.fn()} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Equipment')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

# Python docstrings (Google style)
def calculate_maintenance_cost(
    equipment: Equipment,
    parts: List[Part],
    labor_hours: float
) -> Decimal:
    """

        >>> cost = calculate_maintenance_cost(equipment, parts, 2.5)
        >>> print(cost)
        Decimal('450.00')
    """
```
